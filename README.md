# Busted Draw Poker

# Background/Objective

  This project is my [Mod3 project](https://github.com/sgold57/mod3-project-draw-poker) updated to use React. This update was done because certain aspects of the app were tough to execute in only vanilla Javascript (namely changing the UI to show the new cards picked). With the ability to use state in React, the app is now functional. I also wanted to create the logic for evaluating the final hand, which I enjoyed doing.
  
  App now functions for more than one hand at a time. User selects how many hands they would like to play (1,3, or 5 hands for now), and scoring system has also been implemented.

 # Potential For Expansion
  
 I thought that with gambling becoming legal in more states, there's a lot of opportunity for expansion and new features.
 
 I do have a NodeJS backend set up, but it really isn't used much at this point in time. One way to utilize this backend moving forward is to add a login so that users can have their own stats and settings. 
  
  My original idea was to incorporate a trivia element to the game where when the user takes a hit, they must answer a questions correctly in order for new cards to be put into their hand. This addition could feasibly be added to the present main poker engine. Ways that this could cultivate more features would be:
  
  - User can select difficulty levels of the questions.
  - User can filter topics of trivia to categories that they would like to answer.
 
  These ideas, combined with creating a users table to store players, could lead to users having their high scores saved, which would add a competitive aspect.
